# ImportLSV
Python code relying only on the Python Standard Library to re-format results from multiple linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments carried out over the same range of potentials into a single table. In the resulting table, the first column is potential (in volts, V), and the following columns correspond to currents (in amperes A) for each experimental run.
